Markov chain	a sequence where given the current state, the next state is conditionally independent of all previous states
Bayesian paradigm	approaching statistics from the perspective that probability can be viewed as a degree of belief in an event
Beta distribution	a probability distribution defined on the interval [0, 1] often used to model probabilities in Bayesian statistics
Exponential distribution	a probability distribution defined on the positive real numbers that can be used to model the time between events in a Poisson point process
Prior	a probability distribution describing our knowledge of a hypothesis/parameter before incorporating new data
Posterior	a probability distribution describing our knowledge of a hypothesis/parameter after incorporating new data
Haplotype	a collection of DNA sequence variants (e.g., alleles) that are spatially close on a chromosome, are usually inherited together, and thus are genetically linked
Marginal distribution	the distribution of a sub-collection of variables after integrating out the remaining variables in the collection.
Monte Carlo integration	a technique for numerical integration where the value of an integral is estimated by simulating data
Quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot)	a plot comparing the quantiles from one distribution (often a theoretical distribution) to the quantiles of another distribution (often from a sample)
Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate	the mode of the posterior distribution associated with the quantity of interest
Escherichia coli	facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms
Epigenetics	the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence
Log-likelihood ratio	the log of the likelihood under one set of assumptions divided by the likelihood under another set of assumptions
Bimodality	when a distribution has two modes
Mixture	in the context of statistics, when the distribution of interest is a combination of two or more different probability distributions
Codon	A three-nucleotide sequence that specifies the amino acid to be created next (or to start or stop synthesis)
Codon bias	the differences in how often each spelling of an amino acid occurs in coding DNA
Genetic code	the set of instructions in a gene that tell the cell how to make a specific protein
