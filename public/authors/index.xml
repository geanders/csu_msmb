      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Lyons is an assistant professor of statistics at Colorado State University. He works in
the area between pre-clinical and clinical drug development for the treatment of tuberculosis.
His focus is the development and application of mathematical and computational tools to better
translate experimental studies to dose selection for clinical trials. This work involves both
conventional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation as well as physiological
modeling and the use of engineering-based approaches to design optimized combination drug
regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
