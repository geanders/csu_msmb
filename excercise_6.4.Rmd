```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
```


```{r}
data("PlantGrowth")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
