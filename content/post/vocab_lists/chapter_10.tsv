Arrows/directed edges	Graph edges that directionally connect nodes
Annotation variables	Graph visualization characteristics that help to demonstrate strength of a link in a graph by changing the width of the edge or covariates associated to the size or color of the node
Graph layouts	Different ways to plot a graph, either for aesthetic or practical reasons
Binary data	Data in which each observation can take only one of two values (e.g., 0 or 1)
Differentially expressed genes	A term to describe changes in gene expression levels between different experimental groups
Bipartite graph	A graph where each edge connects a node
Overrepresented or enriched	In the context of gene expresion, a term to describe increased expression of a gene / set of genes of interest
Gene Ontology (GO)	A resource aimed to unify the vocabulary to describe genes and gene product attributes across all species
Fisher's exact test / Hypergeometric testing	Two-way table testing used to account for the fact that some categories are extremely numerous and others are rarer
Known skeleton graph	A graph that projects significance scores such as p-values
Perturbation	In the context of a network, an alteration of the function of a biological system, induced by external or internal mechanisms
Hotspots	In the context of a graph, areas with high event density
Rooted binary tree	A data tree in which each node has at most two children
Cycles	In the context of graphs, another word for loops: either self-loops or ones that go through several vertices
Ancestral taxa	Correspond to inner nodes and are inferred from the contemporaneous data on the tips
Contemporaneous	In the context of data for phylogenetic tress, organisms at terminal nodes that exist at the same time and are related to each other, thus revealing information about their common ancestors 
OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units)	A method of clustering organisms based on DNA similarity of a certain taxonomic marker gene (Tips of the tree)
Parameter	In the context of statistics, numerical value that describes a population
Gene trees	Structures produced when different genes show differences in their evolutionary histories
Markov chain	A sequence where given the current state, the next state is conditionally independent of all previous states
Molecular clock hypothesis	A term that describes a technique that uses the mutation rate to infer what happened to a species historically
Non-identifiability	The inability to distinguish a parameterization of a model based on observed data
Time homogeneity	In the context of Markov chains, the state of the mutation rate being constant across history
Generator	In the context of Markov chains, the instantaneous change probability matrix describing transitions between steps of the chain
Transition matrix	A matrix that contains all probabilities of any state changes for a Markov chain
Parsimony tree	A structure created using nonparametric method that minimizes the number of changes necessary to explain the data
Maximum likelihood tree	A structure created using a parametric method that uses efficient optimization algorithms to maximize the likelihood of a tree under the model assumptions.
Bayesian posterior distributions for trees	A method that uses MCMC to find posterior distributions of the phylogenies
Distance-based methods	Semi-parametric methods similar to the hierarchical clustering algorithms but use the parametric evolutionary models
Aligning	Arranging different sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein together to identify similarities or differences between them
indel (inserted-deleted) event	Insertion or deletion of bases in the genome of an organism
Filtering operations	In the context of low-quality rRNA reads, the removal of low-quality reads and trimming of remaining reads to a consistent length
Interactive	In the context of a plot, enabling direct actions on a graphical plot to change elements and link multiple plots
Spanning tree	A tree that goes through all points at least once
Minimum spanning tree (MST)	Given distances between vertices, a tree that spans all the points and has the minimum total length
Jitter	To slightly move coordinates on a graph to avoid too much overlapping
Undirected network 	A term describing a graph without arrows between nodes
Associated	A term indicating that two variables are related
Friedman-Rafsky tests	Tests for two/multiple sample segregation on a minimum spanning tree
Pure edges	In the context of graphs, edges whose two nodes have the same level of the factor variable
Microbiome	The aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within an organism tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside
Exponential random graph models (ERGMs)	Models that can be used to predict vertex covariates
Protein interaction networks	In the context of graphing, a way to visualize observed protein-protein interactions
Phylogenetic tree	A tree used to visualize evolutionary relationships among species
Strain	In the context of a virus, a genetic variant or subtype
Taxa	A group of one or more populations of an organism making up a single unit, typically disected to the level of genus and species
Protein	A compound made up of amino acids; one of the four types of macromolecules that make up living organisms.
