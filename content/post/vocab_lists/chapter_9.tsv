multidimensional scaling (MDS)	a linear dimension reduction method applied in cases where distances between observations are available
clusters	in the context of data analysis, data points that group together
robust	in the context of a statistical method, a 'sturdy' estimator that is not heavily influenced by outliers
outlier	a single data point with large distances to other data points, thus potentially dominating and skewing the analysis
breakdown point	a measure of the robustness of an estimator; larger values indicate more robust estimators
non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)	a robust ordination method which attempts to embed data points in a new space while maintaining their respective order to one another
metadata	information, data, or descriptions that characterize other data
batch effects	hidden factors that affect the data but are not documented; e.g. running samples at the same time have a degree of similarity from being run in the same batch
confounded effects	a term describing when there is uncertainty in the source of variation impacting data
supplementary	in the context of variables for a statistical model, categorical variables added to continuous variables in heterogenous data
supplementary points	points created using the group-means of points in each of the groups
interactive	in the context of plots, data visualizations that can be manipulated in real time by the observer
contingency table	the result of counting the co-occurrence of any pair of categorical variables measured in a set of observations; for example, two phenotypes
chi-square distance	weighted Eucledian distance using relative counts and standardized by the mean, not the variance
biplots	a type of exploratory graph that displays information on both the observations and the variables of a data matrix
co-occurence matrix	a matrix that captures the extent to which variables are jointly observed in observations
correspondence analysis (CA) / dual scaling	a method for computing low dimensional projections that explain dependencies in categorical data
ordination method	a method which enables one to detect and interpret a hidden ordering, gradient or latent variable in the data
clustering	in the context of statistical methods, a way to detect and interpret a hidden factor/categorical variable
kernel	a linear algorithm designed to determine a non-linear decision boundary; used in pattern analysis to better understand general types of relations like clusters, rankings, principal components, or correlations
local linear embedding (LLE)	a nonlinear method for estimating nonlinear trajectories by points in the relevant state spaces
isomap	a nonlinear method for estimating nonlinear trajectories by points in the relevant state spaces
inertia	in the context of counts in a contingency table, the weighted sum of the squares of distances between observed and expected frequencies
covariance	measure of the joint variability of two random variables
matrix association	correlation of vectors derived from matrices based on dissimilarity
RV coefficient	the global measure of similarity of two data tables as opposed to two vectors; correlation coefficient for tables
penalty	a method to constrain the typical optimization algorithm, added to interpret correlation when there are too many degrees of freedom
sparsity penalty	an approach to maintain the number of non-zero coefficients to a minimum
heterogenous data	a mixture of many continuous and a few categorical variables 
canonical correlation	a method for finding a few linear combinations of variables from each table that are as correlated as possible
nonlinear	a regression equation where the equation is not 'linear in the parameters,' meaning the relationship between parameters cannot be calulated by multiplying, exponentiating, or transforming independent variables
species tree	a simplified term for a diagram showing the relatedness of organisms based on biological, often genetic sequence, information
assay	an investigative (analytic) procedure in laboratory medicine, pharmacology, environmental biology and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity of a target entity (the analyte)
protocol	a predefined written procedural method of conducting experiments
microarray	a 'lab-on-a-chip' method to assess many samples at once, often used in gene expression studies
taxon	a group of one or more populations of an organism making up a single unit, typically disected to the level of genus and species
mutation	an alteration in the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism or virus
phenotype	a visually observed genetic trait or characteristic
cell development	the process of a cell transitioning from one state to another, such as in the case of a cell transitioning from growth to division in mitosis
metabolite	an intermediate or end product of metabolism; typically a small, organic molecule
