principal component analysis (PCA)	an unsupervised ordination method used to reduce the dimensionality of data by creating scores that maximize the explained variation in the data
matrix	a two dimensional arrangement of rows and columns used to store data
mass spectroscopy	a measurement procedure based on the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, often used to measure metabolite abundance
correlation coefficient	a measure of how two variables co-vary, reported as a single summary value
centering	subtracting the mean of the data so the new mean is 0
scaling / standardizing	dividing data values by the data's standard deviation so the new standard deviation is 1
data simplification	a broadly applicable term referring to the process of summarizing or reducing the dimensions of multivariate data
dimension reduction	summarizing data to reduce the number of variables for downstream analyses
principal scores	a normally distributed z-score assigned to each subject that corresponds with the specific ordering and weighting of original variables within a given principal component
unsupervised learning	a machine learning method used to find patterns in the data without a priori variable ranking or labeling
status	in the context of variables in a statistical learning algorithm, a ranking or labeling of variables (e.g., to consider one variable as the outcome or goal and the rest as potential predictive variables)
projection	a representation of data from a higher dimensional space to a lower dimensional space
linear	in the context of a statistical technique, a description that describes the search for relationships between variables that can be expressed as a linear combination of predictors
regression line	a linear function of the form y = mx + b which is used to project two-dimensional data onto a 1 dimensional line
linear regression	a supervised method that models the relationship between explanatory and response variables by minimizing the residual sum of squares with respect to the response variable
supervised learning	in the context of a statistical learning technique, a machine learning method that uses specified, user defined inputs to map patterns (input/output associations) in data
predictor	an independent, explanatory, or 'x' variable in a model
response	an outcome or 'y' variable in a model that is thought to be affected by a predictor
principal components	uncorrelated latent variables created by the PCA procedure, of which there are as many as there are original variables entered into the procedure
inertia	in the context of variability of points, the total variance of a point cloud based on the sum of squares of the projection of points 
linear combination	mathematical expression in which terms are scaled by constants and then added together
loadings	in the context of principal components, these values quantify the weight of each original variable in a principal component
singular value decomposition (SVD)	a way to decompose a rectangular matrix by factoring it into three different matrices in a way that has some useful mathematical applications
rank	in the context of a matrix, the maximum number of linearly independent column or row vectors
norm	in the context of a vector, a positive scalar quantity reflecting its size/magnitude
singular value	a non-negative, normalizing value from a singular value decomposition quantifying the relative importance of the corresponding singular vectors
orthonormal	the characteristic of a set of vectors that are both orthogonal (uncorrelated) and normalized
principal plane	a 2-dimensional space across which the data are most spread out or variable 
 trace	in the context of matrices, the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix
 supplementary information	extra information or instruction to help clarify research question, procedure or results
metadata	information, data, or descriptions that characterize other data
biplot	a type of exploratory graph that displays information on both the observations and the variables of a data matrix
biometric characteristics	physical, physiological, demographic, or behavioral features of an organism that can be measured and quantified
proliferation rate	speed at which the number of cells increase through the process of cellular division
gene expression profile	a snapshot measure of the level of activity/expression (transcription) of a collection (thousands) of genes, representing a global measure of gene function
T-cell populations	groups of differentiated white blood cells that function in immune response
operational taxonomic units (OTUs)	clusters of closely related species of bacteria based on sequence similarity
transcriptome data	the complete set of all RNA molecules measured from a biological sample generated from genome-wide sequencing methods, like RNA-seq
sequence read	an inferred sequence of base pairs, or fragments of the genome, generated from one of many genomics methods
proteomic profile	a snapshot measure of the levels of all proteins measured in a biological sample 
molecule	two or more chemically bond atoms that lack a charge
m/z ratio	mass to charge ratio used in mass spectrometry to differentiation molecules
wild-type	a normal allele or phenotype that occurs under natural conditions
