<h2>Exercise 2.3 from Modern Statistics for Modern Biologists</h2>
<p>A sequence of three nucleotides codes for one amino acid. There are 4 nucleotides, thus <span class="math inline">\(4^3\)</span> would allow for 64 different amino acids, however there are only 20 amino acids requiring only 20 combinations + 1 for an “end” signal. (The “start” signal is the codon, ATG, which also codes for the amino acid methionine, so the start signal does not have a separate codon.) The code is redundant. But is the redundancy even among codons that code for the same amino acid? In other words, if alanine is coded by 4 different codons, do these codons code for alanine equally (each 25%), or do some codons appear more often than others? Here we use the tuberculosis genome to explore codon bias.</p>

<p>Use <code>table</code> to tabulate the <code>AmAcid</code> and <code>Codon</code> variables.</p>

<h1>b) The <code>PerThous</code> variable</h1>
<p>How was the <code>PerThous</code> variable created?</p>
<p>The sum of all of the numbers of codons gives you the total number of codons in the M. tuberculosis genome: <code>all_codons</code>. Remember that this is not the size of the M. tuberculosis genome, but the number of codons in all M. tuberculosis genes. To get the size of the genome, multiply each codon by 3 (for each nucleotide) and add all non-coding nucleotides (which we do not know from this data set).</p>

<p>The <code>PerThousands</code> variable is derived by dividing the number of occurrences of the codon of interest by the total number of codons. Because this number is small and hard to interpret, multiplying it by 1000 gives a value that is easy to make sense of. Here is an example for proline. The four values returned align to the four codons that each code for proline.</p>

<p>Next, calculate the observed frequencies for each codon seen in the data set and use the chi-squared test statistic to determine if the difference between expected and observed codon frequencies is even or if some codon sequences are used more than others.</p>
<p>To start, you can group the data by amino acid and then determine a few things about
the amino acid or the possible codons for it, including the total observations
across all codons for the amino acid (<code>total</code>), the number of codons for that
amino acid (<code>n_codons</code>), and the expected count for each codon for that amino acid
(the total number of observations for that amino acid divided by the number of
codons, giving an expected number that’s the same for all codons of an amino
acid; <code>expected</code>).</p>

<p>The <code>mutate</code> function is used after <code>group_by</code> to do all this
within each amino acid group of codons, but without collapsing to one row per
amino acid, as a <code>summarize</code> call would.</p>
<p>To convince yourself that this has worked out correctly, you can repeat
the plot we made before and see that the bars for the expected values are
always equal across all codons for an amino acid:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(codon_compared, aes(x=Codon, y=expected)) +
     geom_col()+
     facet_wrap(~AmAcid, scales=&quot;free&quot;) +
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-02-19-exercise-solution-for-chapter-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Finally, we can calculate the chi-squared (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>) statistic and compare it to the
chi-squared distribution to get the p-value when testing against the null hypothesis
that the amino acid observations are uniformly distributed across codons. The <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>
is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\chi^2 = \sum_i{\frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}}
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(O_i\)</span> is the observed value of data point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (<code>Number</code> in our data); and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> is the expected value of data point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (<code>expected</code> in our data)</li>
</ul>
<p>In our data, we can calculate the contribution to the total <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> statistic
from each data point (in this case, each codon within an amino acid) using
<code>mutate</code>, and then
add these values up using <code>group_by</code> to group by amino acid followed by
<code>summarize</code> to sum up across all the data points for an amino acid.
The other information we need to get is the number of codons for the
amino acid, because we’ll need this to determine the degrees of freedom
for the chi-squared distribution. Next, we used <code>mutate</code> with
<code>pchisq</code> to determine the p-values within each amino acid group for the
test against the null that the codons are uniformly distributed for that
amino acid (i.e., that there isn’t codon bias). These p-values turn out to
be super small, so we’re using a technique to get the log-transform versions of
them instead, which we explain a bit more later. Finally, we used <code>arrange</code> to
list the amino acids by evidence against uniform distribution of the codons,
from most evidence against (smallest p-value so most negative log(p-value))
to least evidence against (although still plenty of evidence against) and added
an <code>index</code> with the ranking for each codon by adding a column with the sequence
of numbers from 1 to the number of rows in the data (<code>n()</code>).</p>

<p>As you may notice, these log transforms of the p-values (which we got rather than untransformed p-values in the <code>pchisq</code> call because we used the option <code>log = TRUE</code>) are large in magnitude and negative (so very tiny once you take the exponent if you re-transformed them to p-values) values. If you tried to calculate the untransformed p-values (and we did!), this number is so small (0.00000000e+00) that it is too small for R—it shows up as exactly zero in R, even though it actually is a very tiny, but still non-zero, number. To get around this issue, we told <code>pchisq</code> to work on these p-values as log transforms, and then we left the p-value as that log-transformed value. A group of numbers that are log transformed will be in the same order as their untransformed versions, so we don’t need to convert back to figure out which amino acid had that smallest p-value. We can just sort the amino acids from most negative to less negative using these log-transformed versions of the p-values. We now have the amino acids ranked from most biased codons (1) to least (19).</p>
