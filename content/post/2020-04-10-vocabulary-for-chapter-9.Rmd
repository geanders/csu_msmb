Chapter 9 covers multivariate methods for heterogenous data. It builds on methods covered in Chapter 7, like dimension reduction, by extending these ideas to more complex, heterogenous data.

The vocabulary words for Chapter 9 are:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#load packages
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)

# Read in vocabulary from tsv into a dataframe
# This is where you'll need to replace the file name with your own
vocab <- read_tsv("vocab_lists/chapter_9.tsv",
                  col_names = c("term", "definition"))

# Print the dataframe as a nice-looking table
vocab %>% 
  kable(align = c("rl"), 
        col.names = c("", "")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover",
                                      "condensed")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "30em")
```
