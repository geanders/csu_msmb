Chapter 11 is focused on learning how to read, write, and manipulate images in R. The first sections are helping the reader understand when to apply different filters and transformations to an image and why it is necessary. It then touches on segmentation and feature extraction, two components that are utilized to simplify an image for machine learning and recognition. Finally, statistal methods are introduced to analyze spacial distributions and spatial point process is introduced on a basic level.

The vocabulary words for Chapter 11 are:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Read in vocabulary from tsv into a dataframe
# This is where you'll need to replace the file name with your own
vocab <- read_tsv("vocab_lists/chapter_11.tsv",
                  col_names = c("term", "definition"))

# Print the dataframe as a nice-looking table
vocab %>% 
  kable(align = c("rl"), 
        col.names = c("", "")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover",
                                      "condensed")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "30em")
```
