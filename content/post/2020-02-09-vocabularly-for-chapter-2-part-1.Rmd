The first portion of Chapter 2 (2.1-2.7) is focused on statistical modeling of data.  It introduces a number of distributions commonly used in statistics, as well as model fitting estimation procedures (e.g. maximum likelihood estimation).

The vocabulary words for Chapter 2, part 1, are: 
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Read in vocabulary from tsv into a dataframe
# This is where you'll need to replace the file name with your own
vocab <- read_tsv("vocab_lists/chapter_2_part1.tsv",
                  col_names = c("term", "definition"))

# Print the dataframe as a nice-looking table
vocab %>% 
  kable(align = c("rl"), 
        col.names = c("", "")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover",
                                      "condensed")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "30em")
```
