## Links for May 14

We are looking forward to hearing about everyone's exercise solutions
today! Please plan for about 10 minutes to talk through yours. We will
let you share the screen when it's your turn. If you would like to follow
along with each post, the "Schedule" section of our website now has
links to all the final versions of blog posts, so you can open those 
for all the currently finalized exercise posts as we get to them.
