Sere Williams is a graduate student in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology at Colorado State University. She recently completed her MSc studying gene expression in rice exposed to drought stress. She's excited to begin her PhD. This year she is rotating through labs working on immune response in tobacco, modeling hormone interactions in Arabidopsis, frost tolerance in weeds, and electron transport in Archaea.
