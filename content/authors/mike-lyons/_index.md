Mike Lyons is an assistant professor at Colorado State University. He works on the development and application of mathematical and computational tools for tuberculosis clinical trials. This work involves both conventional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation as well as physiological modeling and the use of engineering-based approaches to design optimized combination drug regimens.
