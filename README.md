Welcome! This repository is my branch of the group-study course, "Modern Statistics for Modern Biologists." 
We are using R to work through example problems from the book:  

[*Modern Statistics for Modern Biology*](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/) by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber

This repo is creating a website for a course. Feel free to visit at https://kind-neumann-789611.netlify.app/.
